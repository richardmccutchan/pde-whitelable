# Kitchen Sink #
_The squeaky-clean Delivery Hero UI kit._

### Contents: ###

* Skeleton as a grid foundation ([Sass build](https://github.com/whatsnewsaes/Skeleton-Sass))
* Delivery Hero UI kit (see demo for visualisation)
* Delivery Hero fonts (Corpid)
* [Normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/)
* jQuery & [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/)

### Notes: ###

* Any files (prefixed with @) inside `/demo/` are only used by the demo page (`index.html`) and can be deleted for production purposes.
* Yes, the `/js/` folder is currently empty (as we build JS plugins, this folder will be populated)
* Feel free to shoot me an [email](mailto:sidney.francois@deliveryhero.com) if you feel like anything is missing.

### Making changes/additions: ###

_Please do not push changes straight to the master._ Work from a branch instead. Once your new version is considered stable, we can include in the master.

**And yes, if you use Kitchen Sink for your own projects you will _not_ push the changes made to this repo.** This `kitchen-sink` repo is **exclusively** a foundation, like any boilerplate. Only changes relevant to the function of the foundation happen in this repo.
