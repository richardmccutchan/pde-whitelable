# Kitchen Sink #
_The squeaky-clean delivery hero UI kit._

### Usage: ###

1. Any files (prefixed with @) inside `/demo/` are only used by the demo page (`index.html`) and can be deleted for production purposes.
2. Yes, the `/js/` folder is currently empty (as we build JS plugins, this folder will be populated)
3. Feel free to shoot me an [email](mailto:sidney.francois@deliveryhero.com) if you feel like anything is missing.

### Making changes/additions: ###

_Please do not push changes straight to the master._ Work from a branch instead. Once your new version is considered stable, we can include in the master.
