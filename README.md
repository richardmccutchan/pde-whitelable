# Kitchen Sink #
_The squeaky-clean Delivery Hero UI kit._

### Usage: ###

1. Any files (prefixed with @) inside `/demo/` are only used by the demo page (`index.html`) and can be deleted for production purposes.
2. Yes, the `/js/` folder is currently empty (as we build JS plugins, this folder will be populated)
3. Feel free to shoot me an [email](mailto:sidney.francois@deliveryhero.com) if you feel like anything is missing.

### Making changes/additions: ###

_Please do not push changes straight to the master._ Work from a branch instead. Once your new version is considered stable, we can include in the master.

**And yes, if you use Kitchen Sink for your own projects you will naturally not push the changes made to this repo.** This kitchen-sink repo is exclusively a foundation, like any boilerplate. Only changes relevant to the function of the foundation happen in this repo.
